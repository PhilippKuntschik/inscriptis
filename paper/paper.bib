	abstract = {Recent years have seen the paradigm shift of Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems from sequence labeling to span prediction. Despite its preliminary effectiveness, the span prediction model's architectural bias has not been fully understood. In this paper, we first investigate the strengths and weaknesses when the span prediction model is used for named entity recognition compared with the sequence labeling framework and how to further improve it, which motivates us to make complementary advantages of systems based on different paradigms. We then reveal that span prediction, simultaneously, can serve as a system combiner to re-recognize named entities from different systems' outputs. We experimentally implement 154 systems on 11 datasets, covering three languages, comprehensive results show the effectiveness of span prediction models that both serve as base NER systems and system combiners. We make all code and datasets available: {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/neulab/spanner\}, as well as an online system demo: {\textbackslash}url\{http://spanner.sh\}. Our model also has been deployed into the ExplainaBoard platform, which allows users to flexibly perform a system combination of top-scoring systems in an interactive way: {\textbackslash}url\{http://explainaboard.nlpedia.ai/leaderboard/task-ner/\}.},

This article presents a collaborative, interdisciplinary process for adapting data-driven research to research questions within other disciplines that considers the methodological background required to obtain a significant impact on the target discipline, guides the systematic collection and formalization of domain knowledge, the selection of appropriate data sources and methods for analyzing, visualizing and interpreting the results. 
Finally, we present a case study that applies the described process to the domain of communication science by creating approaches that aid domain experts in locating, tracking, analyzing and finally better understanding the dynamics of media criticism.  The study clearly demonstrates the potential of the presented method but also shows that data-driven research approaches require a tighter integration with the methodological framework of the target discipline to really provide a significant impact on the target discipline.},

	abstract = {With technological advancements that cultivate vibrant creation, sharing, and collaboration among Web users, investors can rapidly obtain more valuable and timely information. Meanwhile, the adaption of user engagement in media effectively magnifies the information in the news. With such rapid information influx, investor decisions tend to be influenced by peer and public emotions. An effective methodology to quantitatively analyze the mechanism of information percolation and its degree of impact on stock markets has yet to be explored. In this article, we propose a quantitative media-aware trading strategy to investigate the media impact on stock markets. Our main findings are that (1) fundamental information of firm-specific news articles can enrich the knowledge of investors and affect their trading activities; (2) public sentiments cause emotional fluctuations in investors and intervene in their decision making; and (3) the media impact on firms varies according to firm characteristics and article content.},

Sentiments reflect feelings and attitudes, while emotions provide a finer characterization of the sentiments involved. With the huge number of comments generated daily on the Internet, besides sentiment analysis, emotion identification has drawn keen interest from different researchers, businessmen and politicians for polling public opinions and attitudes. This paper reviews and discusses existing emotion categorization models for emotion analysis and proposes methods that enhance existing emotion research. We carried out emotion analysis by inviting experts from different research areas to produce comprehensive results. Moreover, a computational emotion sensing model is proposed, and future improvements are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Social media mining could be a possible strategy to retrieve drug safety information. The mining of social media is a complex process under progressive evolution, falling into three broad categories: listening (safety data reporting), engaging (follow-up), and broadcasting (risk communication). This systematic review is aimed at evaluating the usefulness and quality of proto-signals by social media listening. Areas covered: In this systematic search, performed according to MOOSE and PRISMA statements, we selected studies, published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar until 31 December 2017, that listened at least one social media to identify proto-adverse drug events and proto-signals. Expert opinion: The selected 38 studies identified serious and unexpected proto-adverse drug events characterized by poorer information quality as compared with spontaneous reporting databases. This feature allows rarely the evaluation of causal relationships. Proto-signals identified by social media listening had the potential of anticipating pre-specified known signals in only six studies. Moreover, the personal perception of patients reported in social media could be used to implement effective risk communication strategies. However, signal detection in social media cannot be currently recommended for routine pharmacovigilance, due to logistic and technical issues.},

   abstract = {Given the intense attention that environmental topics such as climate change attract in news and social media coverage, key questions are how different stakeholders perceive observable threats and policy options, how public media react to new scientific insights, and how journalists present climate science knowledge to the public. This paper investigates the potential of semantic technologies to address these questions. After summarizing methods to extract and disambiguate context information, we present visualization techniques to explore the lexical, geospatial and relational context of topics and entities referenced in these repositories. The examples stem from the Media Watch on Climate Change, the Climate Resilience Toolkit and the NOAA Media Watch - three applications that aggregate environmental resources from a wide range of online sources. These systems not only show the value of providing comprehensive information to the public, but also have helped to develop a novel communication success metric that goes beyond bipolar assessments of sentiment.},
